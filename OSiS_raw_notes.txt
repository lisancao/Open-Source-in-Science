Open Source in Science: 
About me: 
-IT person for a Linux Computer lab at a non-profit 

-traditional Open source (decentralization through forking), which would be great in science
	-what is open source? (+ licensing, like creative commons)
	-Scientists now are expected to make full use of the technological advancements that have occurred within the last 20 years 
	
-what i will be talking about today (centralization), which we need to do first 
-linear model of software usage in science
	-licensing and financial investments prevent innovation, openness to new software, and promote rigidness. 
		-e.g. microsoft office, matlab, SAS/SPSS 
	-code in these softwares are developed by a single team, so updates can be slow to roll out, vulnerabilities unknown and are just seen as 'quirks' of the software 

	-Science right now is a capitalistic endeavor, and it shouldn't be 

-reproducibility
	-the need for source code 
	
-transparency 
	-why the black box model is NOT okay in research 
	
-contributability 
	-chances are, if you are a scientist outside of a computer science field, your coding skills are not great 
		-well, why not pay coders to do it? because unfortunately, they do not know your data, goals, and needs as well as you do! 
		-results in collaboration where no one knows what the other is doing 
	-chances are as well, that even if you are good at coding, you are not able to write an entire program yourself 
	-open source projects like the Linux Kernel have proven it beneficial to allow contributers in and expose software and security vulnerabilities 
	-let coders help!
		-US department of defense as an example 
	-let there be proper documentation! 
	-let there be usage guidelines! (open source licensing) 
	-*let there be some sort of centralization*, counterintuitive, I know 
	
-Teachability 
	-it's easier to learn a software that has a big community, and that you can access for free without paying for it first 
	-you can actually look at the source code to see what it's doing, instead of just learning how to navigate the GUI 
	
-Analysis workflow optimization 
	-example: kubernetes 

	
-Finances: 
	-$$ spent every year on licensing software 
	
-Reproductive organs on a computer chip 	

-The C. Elegans Kickstarter 
	
-Integration of Open AI 	
	
-Successes of open source science: (examples)



-example: reproducing bioinformatics analyses without the source code or data? 
	-basically moot, requires full trust 

-Everyone's writing their own packages that essentially do the same thing, and chances are they would be doing it better if they collaborated 

-Barriers to open sourcing in science 

-Lessons from the Python Community: 

-open data movement
-open science movement (preprinting, etc) 

-From a neuroinformatics standpoint: 
	-allen institute 

-In a world where coding is now a part of our daily lives, whether we like it or not, let's make it as easy as possible to help ourselves and to help others
